# Usage:
nmapxmlparse csv *nmap-xml-input-filename* *csv-output-filename*

# About:
I didn't like the options I found when looking for something to convert *nmap* XML output to CSV so I made this thing.

It currently doesn't convert all of the fields over to the CSV and doesn't do anything else but there are future plans.
